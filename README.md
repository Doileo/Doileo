# Hi there! 👋

I’m Doina, a front-end developer who’s passionate about creating user experiences that are not only functional but thoughtful. Frontend development brings me back to the days when I ran my small business, where I put care into every detail—from how I packaged orders to how I connected with customers. Now, I bring that same heart into my coding, focusing on making things accessible and enjoyable for everyone. As an ENFJ-A, I love collaborating and building meaningful connections, and I’m always eager to learn and grow along the way.

Thank you so much for stopping by—I’d love to connect!
