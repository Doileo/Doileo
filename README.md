# Hi there! 👋

I’m Doina, a front-end developer who’s passionate about creating user experiences that are not only functional but thoughtful. Frontend development brings me back to the days when I ran my small business, where I put care into every detail—from how I packaged orders to how I connected with customers. Now, I bring that same heart into my coding, focusing on making things accessible and enjoyable for everyone. As an ENFJ-A, I love collaborating and building meaningful connections, and I’m always eager to learn and grow along the way.

Thank you so much for stopping by—I’d love to connect!

🚀 **Currently Crafting:** 
I’m building user interfaces that are both functional and visually appealing, with a focus on React. Check out my latest projects below!

🌱 **Always Learning:** I’m diving into new frontend trends, especially around making websites more accessible for everyone. I believe in creating inclusive experiences and would love to connect with others who share this passion.

💬 **Let's Chat:** I value open communication! Feel free to reach out to discuss frontend topics, exchange ideas, or just have a friendly chat.

## ⚡ Fun Fact
When I’m not coding, I love capturing the beauty of the sky through photography. It helps me stay grounded and inspires my creativity.
